## Essay (ethics)   


Work solo. **IMPORTANT**: read [the lecture on ethics](/docs/ethics.md) before you start.


## What to write
- Using these <a href="/etc/img/12steps.png">7 steps</a> as an outline
- Address one of the [case studies](https://onlineethics.org/resources?combine=software&field_keywords_target_id=&field_resource_type_target_id=13236)


YOur answer must cover, at the very least:
- who is _hurt_ by the current design;
- how we might _fix_ that?
  - Important: ensure that your  text justifies why  the new design addresses the  problems you document.
- and how will your fix _empower traditionally disempowered social groups_?
  - ie. don't just fix this particular problem; rather, address   deeper issues that might cause problems in the future).


## Word limit
- No less that three pages (in the format shown below, excluding references);
  - no more than four
- HARD LIMITS: 
  - we will not grade after four pages.
  - we will not read if less than three.
  - we will not read if it is the wrong format (see below)

## Grading Rubric


|Grade | What | Notes|

|2 | GATHER RELEVANT FACTS | +1 if it gather assess relevant facts and +1 more if does it well; e.g. extensive literature review |
|2 | IDENTIFY STAKEHOLDERS | +1 if it identifies the stakeholders and +1 more if does it well; e.g. shows how skackholder requirements can be contradictory|
|5 | LIST OF 5 OPTIONS | +5 if it develops a list of iat least five options |
|3 | SOFTWARE DESIGN | +2 of some of those options need to includes a redesign for a better version of the software where the better software mitigates some of the issues discussed by the original software. And +1 more if it does it well; e.g. clever design|
|4 | TESTING | 2 if it tests options using criteria like  harm, publicity, defensibility, reversibility, virtue, colleague, professional, organizational test ( see guidance on that at https://github.com/txt/se20/blob/master/etc/img/12steps.png) And 2 more if it does it well; e.g. writes extensively insightful notes on three or more of the tests |
