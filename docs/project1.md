# Project1


Aim: assess and reuse other people's code.


- Here, you will be working with code written by students from this subject from the last three years.
- Try and remember all the pain points seen in the following project.

Deliverables: 


- Part1 (easy): for five prior projects, score them according to the [project2 rubic](project2.md).
  - Which, in summary, means "does this repo loo **good** (defined before)
  - To make that more precise, score all five repos as per the project2 rubric
    - And note that that we will be using that rubric to score your project2 submissions.
-   Part2 (hard): for one prior project, a 2 minute YouTube video (with a 2023 date) showing you can run that system
  - Expectation management:
    - Probably, your first selected project will NOT run in 2023. So you will try this and that and after much cursing, switch to another project.
- Part3 (important): Write 750 words in a mardown file describing what was hard about this process, how that pain could have been avoided and
    **what practices you are committing to perform in project2** to avoid that pain.


To find your five, look for your project number in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SksEQ4_aKlqNwpXwh_Lsi_oh2PsWCBfhYhvN67MQY3k/edit#gid=1815922898):
- And if you are totally in love with code other than this five just let ask us for permission to substitute
  - which we may not give if TOO MANY groups keep asking for the SAME project.
- To ask for permission to switch projects, please use the [#project1 channel](https://discord.com/channels/1141723836409188436/1142157904707846244)


How to submit:
- Create a public Github repo (not at NC state)
- a sub-directory "proj1"
- Place your score cards and link to video into "proj1/README.md"
- Submit a url to your GH project to Moodle.


## Good practices for Effective Teaming


|What | Notes|
|-----|------|
|Location| Meet however it makes teams most comfortable (in-person, on-line, whatever the team agrees on).|
|Duration| Usually, keep meetings short (exception: long range direction meetings) |
|End of meeting | Always agree on next meeting time before this meeting ends.|
|| Review everyone's to do list|
|Start of meeting | review everyone's to do lists from last meeting|
|Misc | Group members attended group sessions|
|Distributed dev model: | decisions made by unanimous vote|
|| group meetings had a round robin speaking order|
|| group meetings had a moderator that managed the round robin| 
|| group meeting moderator rotated among  the group|


## What do we mean by a "good repo"


Good repos have bling:

## On the merits of a "boast video"


Yes, when "selling" your project it is tempting to prepare a short glossy video. 
- But consider, many of the above GH repos have no video, but very informative text/graphics
- So reflect on the value of "fluffy video" that might bother someone,
  - Versus actual succinct semantic comments.
- So a glossy video might actually be an anti-pattern that drives people away.
